## Phase 2

- [x] Versioned migration authored for research notes, evidence metadata, timeline events, project tasks, private `evidence` Storage bucket restrictions, indexes, triggers, and RLS policies.
- [x] Project detail workspace implemented with Overview, Research Notes, Evidence, Timeline, and Tasks tabs backed by authenticated server mutations.
- [x] Direct signed evidence upload flow implemented without service-role keys, with metadata finalization, orphan cleanup on finalization failure, file replacement safety, and private signed download URLs.
- [x] Edit UI implemented for Research Notes, Evidence, Timeline Events, and Tasks.
- [ ] Phase 2 migration applied to live Supabase database (blocked unless `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is configured in the execution environment).
- [ ] Browser acceptance against live Supabase for Phase 2 workspace modules.

## Phase 3

- [x] Additive migration authored for CTI entities, relationship tables, constraints, indexes, updated_at triggers, authenticated-scoped RLS policies, and atomic relationship replacement RPC.
- [x] Project CTI tabs and detail routes implemented for Threat Actors, Campaigns, Indicators, Malware, CVEs, and MITRE Mapping with authenticated create, list, detail, edit, delete, search/filter/sort, validation, and searchable relationship controls.
- [x] CTI relationship model documented in README.md and docs/RELATIONSHIPS.md.
- [ ] Phase 3 migration applied to live Supabase database (blocked unless `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is configured in the execution environment).
